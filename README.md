# railways-website
The project of website of fake railways. The site provides a few functionalities, like display current lines, searching connections between chosen stations or buy and generate tickets for the chosen connections. To use some of the options, the user need to sign up and sign in after that. This application is based on the MongoDB, where are stored informations about current trains, users, lines and so on. The searching algorithm has been written by myself, it is simillar to the Dijkstra's algorithm, but with other relaxation condition.
